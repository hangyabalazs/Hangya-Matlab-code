function Z = linkage(Y, method)
%LINKAGE Hierarchical cluster information.
%   LINKAGE(Y) computes the hierarchical cluster information, using the
%   single linkage algorithm, from a given distance matrix Y generated
%   by PDIST. Y is also commonly known as similarity or
%   dissimilarity matrix.
%
%   LINKAGE(Y, method) computes the hierarchical cluster information using
%   the specified algorithm. The available methods are:
%
%      'single'   --- nearest distance
%      'complete' --- furthest distance
%      'average'  --- average distance
%      'centroid' --- center of mass distance (approximate, computed
%                     using a formula that is exact if Y contains
%                     Euclidean distances)
%      'ward'     --- inner squared distance
%
%   Cluster information will be returned in the matrix Z with size m-1
%   by 3, where m is the number of observations in the original data. 
%   Column 1 and 2 of Z contain cluster indices linked in pairs
%   to form a binary tree. The leaf nodes are numbered from 1 to
%   m. They are the singleton clusters from which all higher clusters
%   are built. Each newly-formed cluster, corresponding to Z(i,:), is
%   assigned the index m+i, where m is the total number of initial
%   leaves. Z(i,1:2) contains the indices of the two component
%   clusters which form cluster m+i. There are n-1 higher clusters
%   which correspond to the interior nodes of the output clustering
%   tree. Z(i,3) contains the corresponding linkage distances between
%   the two clusters which are merged in Z(i,:), e.g. if there are
%   total of 30 initial nodes, and at step 12, cluster 5 and cluster 7
%   are combined and their distance at this time is 1.5, then row 12
%   of Z will be (5,7,1.5). The newly formed cluster will have an
%   index 12+30=42. If cluster 42 shows up in a latter row, that means
%   this newly formed cluster is being combined again into some bigger
%   cluster.
