% [optW, C, W] = sskernel(x,W,str)
%
% Function 'sskernel' returns optimal bandwidth (standard deviation) 
% of the Gauss density function used in kernel density estimation.
% Optimization principle is to minimize expected L2 loss function between 
% the kernel estimate and an unknown underlying density function. 
% An assumption made is merely that samples are drawn from the density
% independently each other.
%
% The optimal bandwidth is obtained as a minimizer of the formula, 
% sum_{i,j} \int k(x - x_i) k(x - x_j) dx  -  2 sum_{i~=j} k(x_i - x_j), 
% where k(x) is the kernel function.

%
% Example usage:
% optW = sskernel(x); ksdensity(x,'width',optW); 
%
% Statistics Toolbox is required to execute ksdensity. 
% If it is not available, define the Gauss function as
% 'Gauss = @(s,w) 1/sqrt(2*pi)/w*exp(-s.^2/2/w^2);'.
% Computing 'mean( Gauss(x-s,optW) )' provides a kernel density estimate at s.
%
% Input argument
% x:    Sample data vector. 
% W (optinal): 
%       A vector of kernel bandwidths.
%       The optimal bandwidth is selected from the elements of W.  
%       Default value is W = logspace(log10(2*dx),log10((x_max - x_min)),50).
%       * Do not search bandwidths smaller than a sampling resolution of data.
% str (optional):	
%       String that specifies the kernel type.
%       This option is reserved for future extention.
%       Default str = 'Gauss'.
%
% Output argument
% optW: Optimal kernel bandwidth.
% W:    Kernel bandwidths examined. 
% C:    Cost functions of W.
